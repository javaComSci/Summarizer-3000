The cleanup of Kamilo Beach is currently being headed by local organizations that work on manually cleaning up the beach through volunteer efforts.
Organizations such as Hawaii Wildlife Fund, a nonprofit organization dedicated to conserving Hawaii’s native wildlife, are working on leading efforts to restore Kamilo Beach to its prior beauty. This organization held its first beach cleanup back in 2003 and has continued to do these cleanups throughout the years. The Hawaii Wildlife Fund has picked up more than 40 tons of marine debris and fishing nets from the beach with the help of its volunteers (“HWF Projects”, n.d.). It relies on contribution and help from locals in order to make these cleanups possible. It is more difficult to get non-locals on these cleanup projects because getting to this beach can be challenging, as it is in a rural and remote area of the island (Perlas, 2018). In addition, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii (B.E.A.C.H), a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing awareness and solutions to the problem of marine debris on the beaches of Hawaii, has removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilio Beach with the help of its volunteers to pick up the trash (“Kamilo Beach”). However, this remote accessibility has not stopped organizations from doing these cleanups and expressing the importance of it. The people of Hawaii and organizations like Hawaii Wildlife Fund have been doing beach cleanup on Kamilo Beach for over a decade now for the sake of both the locals and the wildlife. These organizations clean up the beaches with the help of hundreds of volunteers each year and have been making progress towards a cleaner beach, but there is around 8 million tons of plastic that finds its way to oceans and beaches like Kamilo Beach.
